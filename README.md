# Rock_Paper_Scissors
My solution to the first JavaScript project from The Odin Project 

I will write de pseudocode here for the program.

First the computer welcomes the player
The computer asks the player to choose rock, paper or scissors.
The computer remembers the choice
The computer chooses rock, paper or scissors randomly
The computer compares the players choice with its choice
If player selected rock and computer scissors, the player wins, show message and record victory for player.
If player selected rock and computer paper, the computer wins, show message and record victory for computer.
If player selected rock and computer rock, it is a tie, show message, record tie.
